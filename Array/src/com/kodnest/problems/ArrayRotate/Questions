Rotate the elements of an array 'k' times:

Problem: We are given an array, and we need to rotate its elements 'k' times towards the right. 
To rotate means to shift every element one position to the right and move the last element to the first position.

Approach: 
The approach we'll take here is straightforward. 
We'll use a temporary variable to hold the last element of the array, 
shift every other element one position to the right,
 and then place the last element at the start of the array.
 We will repeat this process 'k' times.
